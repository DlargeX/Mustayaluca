Mustayaluca
==================================================================================================

This is a continuation of the skin Mustayaluca orginally started by macardi over Psycho Reptile and now dlarge500

The best description is a quote from macardi inital post.

"The inspiration comes from various sources as you can see. Some parts are more or less rip off´s from other skins like the home screen which orgins from djh´s AEON over at XBMC. Other inspirations comes from crj´s work over at Meedios and some inspiration have been taken from joostzilla and his Maya skin. So basically its a blend from various sources combined with my own ideas."
